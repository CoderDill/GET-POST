Part One:

1 - HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol which sets rules for sending/receiving data to a server.
2 - A URL is an address to find a specific internet resource.
3 - DNS stands for Domain Name System which takes ip's and gives them a human readable name.
4 - A query string allows you to pass key value pairs into the URL.
5 - GET and POST where GET retrieves data and POST sends data to a server.
6 - It's a request made by the client to the server following HTTP Protocol.
7 - It's the response from the server to the client following HTTP Protocol.
8 - HTTP headers are where addiontional data is stored. 
Examples:
    request headers: Host and Cookie,
    response headers: Content-Type, Set-Cookie
9 - First - Turn Domain Name into ip address (DNS) and Send request to get data.
    Second - check computer cache, router, isp and then server for request
    Third - server responds with result (200 if ok)
    Fourth - DOM is created from HTML, DOM finds other resources, any requests from those resources are made by the broswer.
